/*
Exposing a ref to your own component 
Sometimes, you may want to let the parent component manipulate the DOM inside of your component. For example, maybe youâ€™re writing a MyInput component, but you want the parent to be able to focus the input (which the parent has no access to). You can use a combination of useRef to hold the input and forwardRef to expose it to the parent component. Read a detailed walkthrough here.

import React, { forwardRef, useRef } from "react"

const MyInput = forwardRef<HTMLInputElement>((props, ref) => {
    return <input {...props} ref={ref} />
})

export const FormTwo: React.FC = () => {
    const inputRef = useRef<any>(null);

    const handleClick = () => {
        inputRef.current.focus();
    }

    return (
        <>
            <MyInput  ref={inputRef}/>
            <button onClick={handleClick}>
                Focus the input
            </button>
        </>
    )
